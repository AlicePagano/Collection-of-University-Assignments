####Â Assignment: DBSCAN and t-SNE

Pattern recognition is a key learning task and clustering methods are one of the most powerful implementations for this aim. Moreover, data visualization techniques are needed to analyze data with several features, which can be challenging for learning algorithms. This work presents DBSCAN clustering method for unsupervised learning and t-SNE method for data visualization. After a theoretical overview of the two algorithms, we test their performances using a 5-dimensional labeled dataset with three embedded manifolds.
