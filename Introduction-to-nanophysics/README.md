## Nanofabrication, characterization and modelling of gold nanoparticles

The aim of this work is the characterization and modelling of spherical gold nanoparticles syn- thetized in laboratory by Turkevich method. At first an absorbance optical measurement was per- formed on the colloidal solution. The experimental data were modelled using the extinction cross section from the Mie theory, in order to obtain an estimate of the radius of the particles, its density and the refractive index of the medium. A Grazing-incidence X-ray Diffraction was performed on the nanoparticles deposited on a Si substrate, to get information about the nanoparticle size and its structure. At last a Scanning Electron Microscope was used to directly measure particle radius and get information about their size distribution.
